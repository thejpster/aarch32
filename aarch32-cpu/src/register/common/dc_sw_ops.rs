///
/// - A: log2(ASSOCIATIVITY) rounded up to the next integer if necessary. For example, a 4-way
///   associative cache will have a value of 2 and a 8-way associative cache will have a value of
///   4.
/// - N: log2(LINE LENGTH). For example, a 32-byte line length (4 words) will have a value of
///   5.
